# Homework

### Part 1
These programs answer the questions posed in the presentation:

1) Write a function that computes the sum of 10 random numbers
2) Write a function that tests if a number is odd or even based on an extra parameter: f(number, odd=True)
3) Write a function that creates a list of random number of random numbers
4) Write a function that finds the maximum for the above list
5) Write a function that sorts the above list
6) Write another function that sorts it (different algorithm)

### Part 2

As an extra I tried several other sorting algorithms and I tried timing them.
I think the timing needs to be improved
- The second time I sort (with the same algorithm) is always faster
- The longer the array the more consistent the times -> That's good!
- Why is my_sort faster shouldn't it be slower?
